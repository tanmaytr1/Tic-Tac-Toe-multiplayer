Socket.IO requires the HTTP server: Socket.IO doesn't work directly with the Express application (app). Instead, it needs to attach itself to the underlying HTTP server.

The flow of creation:

First, you create an Express app (const app = express())

Then you create an HTTP server using Node's http module, passing the Express app (const server = http.createServer(app))

Then you initialize Socket.IO with this server (const io = new Server(server))

Why not app.listen()?

If you used app.listen(), it would create its own HTTP server internally, but then you wouldn't have a reference to that server to pass to Socket.IO

By explicitly creating the HTTP server first, you can then pass it to both Express and Socket.IO

Functionally equivalent but more flexible:

app.listen() is essentially just a convenience method that does http.createServer(app).listen()

By doing it manually, you gain the ability to attach other things (like Socket.IO) to the same server

So in summary, we use server.listen() instead of app.listen() because:

We need the server reference for Socket.IO

We want both Express and Socket.IO to use the same server instance

It gives us more control over the server configuration
